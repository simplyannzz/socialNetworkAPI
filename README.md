## Installation

I used the tools that I had on my computer, like Git, Vscode, Github, and Google. First, I cloned the repo into my local file, made a GitHub repo, and named both the local and global repo. I used Insomina to check if my GET, POST, DELETE is working with my database.

## Usage

1. Launch server
2. Open on Insomina
